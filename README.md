# munisfun
(Pronounced "em you en is eff you en")

###How to Run - With NodeJS

Until there is a UI, MUNisFUN must be run on the command line. JavaScript must be run using a JavaScript engine or [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). With NodeJS, you can run app.js by
```Bash
$ node app.js
```

###How to Run - Without NodeJS

On a Mac, app.s can be run on Terminal for OSX by
```Bash
$ jsc app.js
```

On Windows
```Bash
D:\> Cscript.exe app.js
```

Many Linux distributions do not come with a JavaScript engine, but you can use [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) by
```Bash
$ rhino app.js
```
